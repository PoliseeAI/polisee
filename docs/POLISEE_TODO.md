# Polisee Development TODO List

## 🎯 Project Overview
Build a personalized legislative impact analyzer that transforms complex bills into personalized impact reports. **Admins upload and manage bills**, while users create personas and view AI-generated analysis results. Users can then provide sentiment feedback on specific bill sections that affect them. You'll handle the frontend (Next.js webapp) and backend (Supabase), while the RAG database team handles document ingestion and vectorization.
