## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Product Name:** Polisee — Personalized Legislative Impact Analyzer

**Prepared By:** [Your Team]
**Date:** July 7, 2025

---

### 1. Executive Summary
Polisee transforms lengthy legislative texts into personalized, verifiable impact reports for citizens. **Administrators upload and manage bills**, while users create detailed personas and view AI-generated analysis results. Users can then provide sentiment feedback on specific bill sections that affect them. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a structured persona intake, and an interactive dashboard of "Impact Cards," Polisee answers "How does this bill affect me?" within minutes.

### 2. Background & Problem Statement
- **Legislative Complexity:** Omnibus bills often exceed 1,000 pages, making manual review infeasible.
- **Citizen Engagement Gap:** Voters and stakeholders struggle to connect policy provisions to their personal circumstances.
- **Hallucination Risk:** AI-generated summaries risk misinformation without clear references to original text.

### 3. Objectives & Success Metrics
- **Objective 1:** Deliver accurate, personalized summaries of a target bill within 30 seconds of submission.
  - *Metric:* 80% of user-validated summaries match expert assessments.
- **Objective 2:** Achieve a user satisfaction score ≥ 4.2/5 in usability tests.
- **Objective 3:** Ensure verifiable claims by linking 100% of summaries to source text.

### 4. Stakeholders
- **Primary:** End users (citizens, journalists, advocacy groups)
- **Secondary:** Product managers, engineers, legal SMEs, UX designers
- **Tertiary:** Policy researchers, legislators

### 5. Assumptions & Constraints
