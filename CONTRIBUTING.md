## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [conduct@polisee.com](mailto:conduct@polisee.com).

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

### Project Architecture

Polisee is built with:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for analysis generation
- **Data Source**: Congress.gov API for legislative data

### Key Concepts

1. **Personas**: User profiles that define demographic information for personalized analysis
2. **Bill Analysis**: AI-generated impact reports based on user personas
3. **Source Citations**: Verifiable links between analysis claims and bill text
4. **Admin Flow**: [[memory:2518544]] Administrators upload and manage bills while users consume analysis
