### Research Categories and Instructions:

### 1. The Law: Legislation & Regulation

   *Objective:** Find an example of a dense, technical legal document that governs housing development. The goal is to find a document that is difficult for a layperson to read.

   *Instructions:** Search for the residential zoning code of a major U.S. city. Good examples to search for include Minneapolis, MN (known for reform); Houston, TX (known for minimal zoning); or Portland, OR.

   *Example Search Query:** "Minneapolis residential zoning code pdf"

### 2. The Numbers: Government Data & Reports

   *Objective:** Find a flagship, data-heavy report from a federal agency that quantifies the scale of the housing affordability problem.

   *Instructions:** Prioritize official reports from sources like the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or the US Census Bureau. The "Worst Case Housing Needs" report from HUD is an ideal example.

   *Example Search Query:** "HUD Worst Case Housing Needs report latest pdf" or "US Census American Community Survey housing cost burden data"

### 3. The Arguments: Opposing Think Tank Analyses

   *Objective:** Find two high-quality reports that represent the primary opposing viewpoints in the housing debate. It is vital that these two documents offer different solutions.

   *Instructions:**

       *A) Pro-Supply / Market-Oriented View:** Find one report arguing that deregulating zoning and land use to increase housing supply is the primary solution. Search the publications of organizations like the Mercatus Center, the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), or the Cato Institute.

       *B) Pro-Intervention / Tenant Protection View:** Find one report arguing for policies such as rent control, expansion of housing vouchers, or other forms of government aid and tenant protection. Search the publications of organizations like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) or the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC).

### 4. The Stakeholders: Industry & Advocacy Positions

   *Objective:** Find two documents that represent the official positions of key stakeholder groups with vested interests in the housing market.

   *Instructions:**

       *A) Industry Voice:** Find a policy statement, press release, or "issue brief" from a group representing home builders or realtors. Search the websites of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) or the National Association of Realtors (NAR) for their stated policy on housing supply.

       *B) Advocacy Voice:** Find a report or statement from a prominent tenants' rights or affordable housing advocacy group. The annual "Out of Reach" report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) is a perfect example.

### 5. The Reality: Public Opinion & Polling

   *Objective:** Find a summary of a national public opinion poll on housing affordability. The goal is to understand the political landscape and public sentiment.

   *Instructions:** Search for polls that gauge American attitudes towards housing costs, local development (NIMBYism), or potential solutions like building more apartments locally. Prioritize credible, non-partisan polling organizations like the Pew Research Center, Gallup, or YouGov.

   *Example Search Query:** "Pew Research poll housing affordability"
